            <h1 class="title">Preface</h1>
            <p>
              A brief introduction to the team design process, our team design process experienced the initial stage, the middle stage, the late stage. In the initial stage, the main task of our team was to find problems and solutions in our chosen field of music education. In the middle of the project, the team is focused on prototyping the product. In the later stage, the team mainly perfected the product prototype and tackled some technical difficulties of the prototype.
            </p>
            <p>Next, I will focus on my main tasks in the whole process of the team. I need to design appropriate music scores in the whole project of the team, and give some necessary guidance in the design of piano keys. In addition, I was mainly responsible for the printing of music scores, the laser printing of happy piano sets, and the writing of related documents.</p>
            <h1 class="title">The early stage</h1>
            <p>In the early stage, when conducting the user survey, I found that the reason why people gave up the piano was basically the same as the reason given by other team members, that is, it was too boring and too difficult. </p>
            <div class="img__box">
              <img src="images/begin03.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>In the early stage of the project, I participated in the design of the appearance of the piano. Due to technical limitations, we could not make a piano with all the keys, so we could only design a couple of important keys in the piano. According to music knowledge, the most important keys in the piano are from the central C(C4) to the central B(B4). Considering the aesthetics of the piano, we have made three more keys from C5 to E5. </p>
            <div class="img__box">
              <img src="images/begin04.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>After finally determining these keys, I looked for  the proportion and size of real keys on the Internet. I hope that our piano keys still maintain the real size and press feeling, so as to meet the requirements mentioned in the requirements to restore the user's real playing experience and habits as far as possible.</p>
            <div class="img__box">
              <img src="images/size.png" alt="">
            </div>
            
            <p>Before our team get final ideation, my other design ideas were considered at the early stage of the project design. I came up with three ideas. For example, I wanted to install a little man behind every piano key, so that the little man would jump when the user pressed a key. If the user plays the wrong note on the piano, the figure will turn around, or the figure will fall back to remind the user. Another idea is to put a track in front of the piano with a running figure on it, and the whole thing is like a progress bar. When the user starts to play, the little man starts to run, and if he plays it wrong, the little man falls down. I think these are good training methods to alert the user when they make a mistake. Another idea is a typesetting game similar to a cop catching a thief, where the user needs to keep the button on the right button at all times to make the cop run so that the thief doesn't get away. But other members of the team said the three products didn't meet the needs of users and dropped those ideas as well. After trial and error of the above ideas, our team finally decided to make a happy piano to help children read music.</p>

            </div>
            <h1 class="title">The interim</h1>
            <p>In the middle of the project, I was mainly responsible for the production and printing of happy piano set and music sheet. </p>
            <p>Firstly, we used a paper prototype, but in order to fit the future setting, the piano kit was finally made from transparent acrylic sheets. In the middle stage of the project, the most important thing that affected the design process was the music score design. At the beginning, I considered using Little Star as the music score, because this song was simple and widely recognized, which was very suitable for children learning piano for the first time. But there was a real challenge in designing the score. Because of technical and hardware constraints, we couldn't put sensors under every note, so we had to reduce the number of notes, and the music score section changed from four to two. </p>
            <div class="img__box">
              <img src="images/score01.png" alt="">
            
            </div>
            <p>Secondly, in the design process, it was found that the size of the notes on the sheet was smaller than that of the press sensor, so the size of the notes on the music sheet need to match the size of each sensor. So, each note should make a suitable hole to install press sensor.</p>
            <p>Finally, when all the external dimensions and parts dimensions of the piano were calculated, I took the data to UQ Innovation for printing.</p>

              <img src="images/interm03.jpg" alt="">
              <img src="images/interm04.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <h1 class="title">The later</h1>
            <p>In the later stage of the project, I was mainly responsible for improving the appearance of the piano, the piano score and the projector. For a better look, the piano was sanded to a frosted effect. In addition, due to technical limitations in the final test, our music score could not identify notes with different time values, so the song in the music score was replaced to ‘two tigers’ , because this song don't have  many notes with different time values. </p>
            <div class="img__box">
              <img src="images/blur.jpeg" alt="">
         
            </div>
            <p>In addition, as a result of the limitation of technology, we found that we cannot implement all note are bright light and touch, so the score is switched design. Specifically, the children need learn necessary notes in this song, after mastering the notes, in according to their own knowledge actively to play the music, the purpose is to deepen understanding of the notes.</p>
