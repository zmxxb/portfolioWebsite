            <p>There is still a gap between our actual final product and our ideal product. To be specific, first of all, from the aspect of appearance and physical structure, the feedback of each key of the piano we designed is not consistent, which leads to the difficulty of pressing the keys in the actual playing process. The main reason for this problem is the lever and rubber band behind each key. Because the elastic force of each rubber band is not consistent and the workmanlike problem of the lever, it is difficult to ensure that the feedback of each key is consistent. Second, the team designed a product with only 10 keys that actually worked, and the ideal product would include all the keys of the piano. Third, the ideal music score should not be made of acrylic sheets, and for vision protection reasons, it is unlikely to use a screen. So the ideal solution is to use an ink screen, which is a kind of screen that does not harm the eyes, and users can complete some operations on the ink screen, which is very convenient. Fourthly, we found that users could not feel the happiness of the 3D projector in the actual playing, because people were more focused on the keys and music score in the actual practice process, while our projector was a certain distance from our piano. Ideally, I think the 3D projector would be mounted on the top of the piano, and the user would be able to see the Tamagotchi out of the corner of his or her eye while actually playing, rather than having to stop playing and turn around to see the Tamagotchi as shown in the actual product.</p>
            <p>In addition, from the perspective of functional technology, our piano can only identify notes, which cannot help children understand all the music theory knowledge well. Ideally, a happy piano should teach a child the common principles of music, including notes, rests, beats, rhythms, and practice sheet music. These can be achieved by using electronic ink screen technology. The piano-equipped tamagotchi encourages users with cute body movements and sounds when they complete a tune or play a wrong note, rather than just dancing when the keys sound, as Exhibit demonstrates.</p>
            <p>We designed this product to solve the problem of children's reading music when they are beginning to learn piano. Compared with some of the existing piano score apps on the market, users still cannot learn music without using their phones or tablets as carriers. The happy piano we designed is more committed to integrating music theory education into the piano. Ideally, through the built-in ink screen of the piano, users can complete a series of operations on the ink screen to complete the study of music theory. In addition, compared with many music education software on the market, it is less interesting and more professional. We hope to design an electronic pet teacher, when the user makes a mistake, the voice will remind the user, if the user does not know how to play, the user can directly ask the electronic pet teacher. Through this kind of hope to be able to directly interact with the electronic pet teacher way, cultivate children's interest.</p>
            <p>
              The team designed the actual product to make children happy by watching the role of a holographic projector during the actual playing. When the user does not know how to play, press the note on the piano score, the corresponding piano keys will light up, so that the user will feel very convenient and helpful. From the Exhibit at the scene, we can see that the scene really learned simple keys and songs with the help of lights.
